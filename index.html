<b>Garden</b>

Growing food is key. You don't need me to point out how expensive 
fruit and vegetables are. Some vegetables are not worthwhile, due to 
time constraints and lack of yield. Vegetables in this catergory are 
cucumber, onions, spinach, cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower. Much 
better are celery, carrots, potatoes, peas, beans, tomatoes, pumpkin, 
capsicum and garlic.   

Prepare a patch of ground with light spade tilling, manure, compost 
and cover with mulch. Allow to sit for two weeks before sowing. 
Pumpkin and capsicum seeds can be easily saved from store bought 
fruit. Store bought garlic cloves can be sown. Certified seed potatoes 
are preferable, as store potatoes are treated with chemicals to 
prevent eyes forming. Seeds for the other vegetables are relatively 
cheap and in most cases, a one time purchase, as you can save your own 
seeds. 

<b>Cash</b>

The economy encourages consumers to spend quickly and conveniently, 
thereby discouraging rational decision making. Paying with cash is 
your best defence to that problem. It will reduce inconspicous 
consumption. 

<b>Own, dont loan</b>

Other than your accomodation, you should aim to own everything 
outright. Buying things on credit is the quickest way to financial 
ruin. Cars, appliances, books, furniture... All these things can be 
bought second hand.
